The data is provided by [Eoin Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eoin-moore-a336838/) and can be found 
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores).

Due to the limitations of Shiny web apps, the dataset used in the published app is filtered down to NBA players with at least 20,000 career minutes played or a draft year of 2013 or later. If you would like to use the full dataset and run the app yourself in RStudio, see below:

  1. Visit Moore's Kaggle link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eoinamoore/historical-nba-data-and-player-box-scores) and download the Players.csv and PlayerStatistics.csv files. The game data is updated daily, so you'll have to redownload the files you want for the most up-to-date stats.
